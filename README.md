# Age of Abalone Shells Data Analysis

This project performs an analysis on the Age of Abalone Shells using a dataset provided in `abalone.csv`. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and a simple predictive model to estimate the age of abalone shells.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset `abalone.csv` should be in the same directory as the script.

## Description

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Load the Dataset**: Reads the dataset from `abalone.csv`.
2. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Displays the first few rows.
   - Provides basic information and summary statistics.
   - Checks for missing values and duplicates.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Histograms of numerical features.
   - Correlation heatmap.
   - Boxplots of numerical features.
4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Uses Linear Regression to predict the age of abalone shells (`Rings`).
   - Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score.


## Running the Code

To run the code, execute the script in a Python environment. Ensure that the `abalone.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.

```bash
python age_of_abalone_analysis.py
```


The script will output the results of the analysis and display various plots for data visualization as given.
